                    Lanette Delbridge Cvhocefkv Tos, I live in Philadelphia, I am currently studying for a bachelors degree in Computer engineering technology at DeVry University,
                    <br>
                    have worked as a barista making coffee, latties and, smoothies for a year and a half and I am looking to start a new career in coding, programming or web development. 
                    <br>
                    I enjoy making chocolate from scratch, foraging with my wild foodies group on meetup.com whenever I get the chance. We forage the Philadelphia and New jersey area though I mostly identify plants instead consuming them but, I have once or twice.
                    <br>
                    I like capoeira, rock climing, camping, taking pictures of nature and family geneology. I study the Mvskoke language and look at the Cherokee language every now and then and also know/understand very liitle spanish.
